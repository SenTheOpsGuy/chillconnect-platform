# Cashfree Payment Integration Status

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. **410 Errors - Booking Expiry**
- **Issue**: Bookings were automatically deleted when payment deadline passed (1 hour before booking time)
- **Location**: `src/app/api/bookings/[id]/status/route.ts:44-60`
- **Status**: ✅ Working as designed (this is intentional behavior)

### 2. **"Provider not found" Error**
- **Issue**: Missing Cashfree environment variables
- **Fix**: Added proper configuration structure
- **Location**: Updated `.env.example` and created `.env.local`
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed - Configuration structure ready

### 3. **Payment Flow Issues**
- **Issue**: Payment page was creating new bookings instead of processing existing ones
- **Fix**: Created new API endpoint for existing booking payment
- **Location**: `src/app/api/bookings/[id]/payment/route.ts` (NEW FILE)
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed - Proper payment flow implemented

### 4. **Enhanced Error Handling**
- **Issue**: Generic error messages made debugging difficult
- **Fix**: Added detailed logging and specific error messages
- **Location**: `src/lib/payments/cashfree.ts:67-77`
- **Status**: ✅ Enhanced - Better diagnostics available

## ✅ Test Endpoints Created

1. **Configuration Test**: `/api/payments/cashfree/test-config`
   - Tests if all environment variables are properly configured
   - Shows callback/webhook URLs

2. **Payment Logic Test**: `/api/payments/cashfree/test-payment`
   - Tests actual Cashfree API integration
   - Validates payment session creation logic

## ✅ Payment Flow Architecture

```
1. User clicks "Make Payment" button
   ↓
2. Call /api/bookings/{id}/payment (NEW ENDPOINT)
   ↓
3. Create Cashfree payment session
   ↓
4. Redirect to Cashfree payment page
   ↓
5. User completes payment on Cashfree
   ↓
6. Cashfree redirects to /api/payments/cashfree/callback
   ↓
7. Callback verifies payment and redirects to success page
   ↓
8. Cashfree sends webhook to /api/payments/cashfree/webhook
   ↓
9. Webhook updates booking status to CONFIRMED
```

## 🔧 Required Actions

### 1. **Update Environment Variables**
Replace placeholder values in `.env.local`:

```bash
# Get these from https://merchant.cashfree.com
CASHFREE_APP_ID="your_actual_cashfree_app_id"
CASHFREE_SECRET_KEY="your_actual_cashfree_secret_key"

# Add your database connection
POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL="your_actual_postgres_url"
POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING="your_actual_postgres_direct_url"
```

### 2. **Test Configuration**
Visit: `http://localhost:3002/api/payments/cashfree/test-config`
Should show: `"configured": true`

### 3. **Test Payment Logic**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/api/payments/cashfree/test-payment \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"amount": 100}'
```
